## How to Read This (Solutions Architect Lens)

You're not reading this as a researcher or data scientist. You're reading as someone who needs to:
1. **Understand** what AI/ML can and can't do
2. **Communicate** with technical teams using the right vocabulary
3. **Decide** when ML is the right tool for a business problem

Read for **concepts and vocabulary**, not for math or implementation details.

## What to Focus On

### High Priority (read carefully, take notes)

- **Definitions of AI and ML** — How does the book define these? Compare to your understanding from the session notes.
- **Types of learning** — Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning. What are the differences? When is each used?
- **The role of data** — What does the book say about data quality, quantity, and preparation? This is where Solutions Architects spend most of their time.
- **Neural network basics** — How the book explains layers, weights, and learning. Compare to the restaurant analogy from the session.
- **Real-world applications** — Any examples the book gives of AI/ML in practice. Note which ones feel like SaaS opportunities.

### Medium Priority (skim for awareness)

- **History of AI** — Useful context for understanding why certain approaches won or lost. Don't memorize dates.
- **Mathematical notation** — Glance at it to recognize the symbols, but don't try to master the formulas yet. That comes later.
- **Specific algorithms** — Note their names and what they're used for. You don't need to understand how they work internally yet.

### Low Priority (skip for now, return later)

- **Proofs and derivations** — You'll never need these as a Solutions Architect
- **Detailed implementation** — Code examples and step-by-step math. Not relevant until you're building pipelines.

## Questions to Answer from the Reading

After reading Chapter 1, write brief answers to these:

1. **What does the book say AI is?** How does this compare to what you learned in the session notes?

2. **What types of problems is ML good at solving?** List at least 3 characteristics.

3. **What's the difference between classification and regression?** Give one SaaS example of each.

4. **What role does data play?** Why does the book emphasize data quality and quantity?

5. **What surprised you?** Was there anything you didn't expect or that contradicted your assumptions?

## After Reading — Connect It

Take 5 minutes to connect the book content to your session notes:

- Did the book reinforce anything from the notes? What?
- Did it introduce anything new that wasn't in the notes? What?
- Did it contradict anything? (Unlikely, but worth checking)
- How does this chapter change or sharpen your SaaS brainstorm ideas?

## Bring to Session 2

Session 2 covers the **ML Solutions Architect Handbook, Chapter 1**. Bring:
- Your completed term definitions
- Your answers to the 5 questions above
- Any concepts that felt unclear after reading
- Your sharpened SaaS brainstorm ideas
